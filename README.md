This is a fully analog keyboard using magnetic keys and hall sensors. I'm using a RP2040 but since it is KMK (circuitpython) based it should be compatible with other boards. I build a split keyboard, but any type form factor should work. 

##Code
To install the code connect your board and install circuitpython. Then copy the content of the "code" folder into the board. For editing the code you can use Thonny or any text editor.

kb.py:
here you define most variables for you specific board.
