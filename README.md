# Analog-Keyboard-kmk-PiPico-NormalSplit

This i a fully analog keyboard using magnetic keys and hall sensors. I'm using a RP2040 but since it is KMK (circuitpython) it should me compatible with other boards. Present are a split and a 60% keyboard but as KMK is farly easy to edit you can create other formfactors.

##Roadmap
- [] Base code for Normal/Split
- [] Analog multiplexer implementation
- [] Multiplexer send key strokes
- [] Threshold and Rapid trigger modes
- [] Create PCB's
- [] Create Case
