# Analog-Keyboard-kmk-PiPico-NormalSplit

This is a fully analog keyboard using magnetic keys and hall sensors. I'm using a RP2040 but since it is KMK (circuitpython) it should be compatible with other boards. Present are a split and a 60% keyboard but as KMK is fairly easy to edit you can create other form factors.

## Roadmap
- [x] Base code for Normal/Split
- [x] Analog multiplexer implementation
- [x] Multiplexer send key strokes
- [x] Threshold mode
- [x] Rapid trigger mode
- [x] test on prototype
- [ ] Create PCB's
- [ ] Create Case
